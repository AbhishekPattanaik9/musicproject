  <h2>Who are they?</h2>
  <p>Vice and Virtue is an India based Dj and music producer group consisting of two friends
     (Manan Vispute and Abhishek Pattanaik). These friends had a common interest for dance music or the EDM boom which started in the early 2010s and found themselves talking all day about the great DJs.They thought to join together and learn the art of Djing as well as music production. During their initial years they were Djing for a weekly radio show on housefreqs.com (A UK based radio hosting website). Then they slowly developed their music production skills, they started producing music in the year of 2016 and have quite developed a lot.They describe their sound as purely EMOTIONAL, ENERGETIC, AND FRESH. Their motive is to spread the joy of dance music, to connect with people and to convey the hidden meaning behind the dance music to the world.</p>
